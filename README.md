So I started this to document the setup steps for getting up and running in any programming language.

Admittedly, there are already many online guides available. This endeavours to find the most straight forward and lowest barrier steps to begin coding (and be productive at it).

## Organization of the guides

The guides will be a step by step run through of installing the runtime for each language. It assumes you have a working knowledge of the Terminal (or Console, Command Prompt in the Windows world). If you don't I have a primer to get you up to speed with your Terminal-fu (er... like kung fu... but with Terminal prefix?).

Guides are mainly written for beginners. So I try my best not to make any assumptions about what you already know. Its *very* basic.

## Available Guides

###Pre-requisites:

* Using the Terminal
